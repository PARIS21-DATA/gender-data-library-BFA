Welcome to the Gender Data Library of Burkina Faso, a comprehensive digital repository developed through a collaborative initiative between the National Institute of Statistics and Demographics (INSD) and PARIS21. This platform brings together a wide range of gender-related documents from diverse sectors, including academic research, international organization reports, policy papers, as well as insights from civil society organizations. Our goal is to provide easy access to reliable, curated gender data that supports policymakers, researchers, and advocates in their efforts to promote gender equality and informed decision-making.

Driven by the need to consolidate scattered gender data and improve its accessibility, the INSD and PARIS21 have utilized advanced technologies like AI and language models to organize and filter information, ensuring that users can navigate the library with ease and find the most relevant content. We invite you to explore our collection and use these resources to better understand the gender landscape in Burkina Faso and drive positive change.
