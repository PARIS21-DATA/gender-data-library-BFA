      The Partnership in Statistics for Development in the 21st Century (PARIS21) aims to improve the production, quality, availability, and use of statistics for informed decision making for sustainable development. It was established in 1999 by the United Nations, the European Commission, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank as a response to the need for accurate and reliable data to achieve and track progress toward development goals.
      <br/><br/>

      PARIS21 works with governments, international organisations, civil society, and other stakeholders to strengthen national statistical systems, promote the use of data for policy making, and foster partnerships and networks in low and middle-income countries.

        The National Institute of Statistics and Demography (INSD) is the central body responsible for producing and disseminating official statistics in Burkina Faso. Established in 1974, the INSD has evolved to support diverse statistical needs across government and public sectors, contributing essential data for informed decision-making. 
    <br/><br/>
        Operating under the Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Development, the INSD coordinates and strengthens the National Statistical System, guiding evidence-based decision-making for development across Burkina Faso. By 2025, INSD aims to establish a modern, efficient, and stable national statistical system that produces and disseminates high-quality data independently and in a timely manner.
